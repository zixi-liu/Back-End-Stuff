## Systems of Version Control and Tools

Centralized (CVCS) vs Distributed (DVCS)
- CVCS: server & client
- DVCS: servers

CI/CD:
- CI: automatically compile the project and run tests on every code change to ensure that the build remains stable and prevent regressions in functionality.
- CD: automatically packages the application and prepares it for deployment. This helps avoid human error when packaging the application.

Continuous Deployment:
- automatically deploying to a test (also known as staging) environment first to validate the deployment package and software changes. Once validated, it can automatically deploy to the live (also known as production) environment for customers.
